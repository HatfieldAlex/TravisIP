# TravisIP
TravisIP is a Django backend project designed to connect with an internal hosting environment. A key challenge for this project will be managing a large, complex database while maintaining performance and flexibility. While Django’s ORM is an option for database interaction, its limitations in handling very large or specialized datasets may require exploring alternative approaches.

Next Steps
1. Set up the Django backend.
2. Integrate Django Rest Framework (DRF)
3. Research and implement an efficient method for linking the backend to a large-scale database
4. Experiment and iterate on backend–database integration strategies
5. Develop and connect the frontend to the backend
